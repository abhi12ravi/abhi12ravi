I am an MSc Data Science student at King's College, London and I like to work on projects that make a large impact. Previously, I've worked on large-scale projects such as SAP S/4 HANA and SAP Business API Hub. 

Additionally, I have volunteered at Mozilla as a Mozilla Tech Speaker and have been invited to multiple international conferences to speak about web development, open-source technologies, and rust programming. I learned here about Open Policy & Advocacy that I adapt in all my open-source GitHub projects.

Furthermore, I held the position of Sustainability Champion at SAP Labs for over 12 months, where I was a core member of the team responsible for successfully implementing the ban of single-use plastic at the 20-acre campus at SAP Labs. Sustainability is truly one of my driving passions.
